# Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning

## This portfolio serves as my collection of projects that I have done throughout my Data Science and Machine Learning Career. These projects delve on various topics such as data visualizations, data mining, and machine learning and explainability models. I have worked with other excellent and promising students for these projects, and I hope that through our work, you get to learn about python coding and data science as well!
